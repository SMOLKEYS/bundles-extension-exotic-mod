status.exotic-mod-0b-emp-weaponry.details = With extensive testing of electrical energy, you have figured out how to use pulses to [#7382f0]disable enemy targets.[]\n\nEMP weapons can lock down enemy units and greatly slow down structures.\n[#e65555]Many targets are not affected by EMP weapons.[] 
status.exotic-mod-0b-beam-weaponry.name = Beam Weaponry
status.exotic-mod-0b-beam-weaponry.details = While looking at laser weapons, you suddenly had the idea of [#7382f0]focusing warden energy.[]\n\nBeams [#7382f0]deal more energy damage[], however [#e65555]deal less base damage.[] Most beam weapons have their own unique secondary behaviour.
status.exotic-mod-0b-flare-weaponry.name = Plasma Flare Weaponry
status.exotic-mod-0b-flare-weaponry.details = Experiments with superheated plasma have allowed you to create flame-like [#7382f0]jets of energy plasma.[]\n\nThis plasma [#e65555]does not deal any energy damage[] and [#e65555]lacks base damage[]. However, anything lacking extreme thermal resistance [#7382f0]tends to melt considerably.[]
status.exotic-mod-0b-superweapons.name = Superweapons
status.exotic-mod-0b-superweapons.details = Does exactly what you think.\n\nYour ambition and greed has brought you here. You have mastered the basics of warden energy, and you now desire to make [#7382f0]weapons of mass destruction.[]\n\nThere are no more tutorials or tips here. Just you, [#e65555]and the suffering you will cause to yourself and others.[]
status.exotic-mod-0b-energy-defense.name = Energy Defenses
status.exotic-mod-0b-energy-defense.details = Instead of flinging energy outwards, you found that you could condense it into a solid area.\n\nUtilizes energy to power [#7382f0]regenerative defenses[] such as healing towers and shielded hardpoints.
status.exotic-mod-0b-barrier-weaponry.name = Barrier Weaponry
status.exotic-mod-0b-barrier-weaponry.details = The best of both worlds. Playing around with energy control has allowed you to create [#7382f0]weapons that shoot defenses.[]\n\nBarrier weaponry [#7382f0]pushes hostile units back[] and [#7382f0]absorbs bullets.[]
status.exotic-mod-0b-steam-heating.name = Steam Heating
status.exotic-mod-0b-steam-heating.details = While dangerously messing around with heat conductivity and nuclear reactors, you discovered how to [#7382f0]boil water in large quantities.[]\nSteam seems to be very important for later [#7382f0]turbine-using structures.[]
status.exotic-mod-0b-condenser-turbines.name = Condenser Turbines
status.exotic-mod-0b-condenser-turbines.details = You managed to hook a water condenser and a better shaft to your turbines, allowing [#7382f0]water to recirculate[] back to your heaters.
status.exotic-mod-0b-wormhole-beacons.name = Wormhole Beacons
status.exotic-mod-0b-wormhole-beacons.details = [accent]< < < REQUIRED TECH > > >[]\n\nAfter attempting to upgrade your Nexus' antenna, you managed to instead create an [#7382f0]interdimensional broadcast antenna.[]\n\nThese antennae can be used to [#7382f0]call in warden reinforcements[], with different broadcasting frequency meshes calling in different starships.\nCoolant for such a broadcast is hard to integrate, leading to antennae [#e65555]overheating after a single use.[] 
status.exotic-mod-0b-fleet-beacons.name = Fleet Beacons
status.exotic-mod-0b-fleet-beacons.details = With some work, and some analysis of high-capacity coolant systems, you have managed to find a way to [#7382f0]cool simpler beacons[] and allow repeated broadcasts.\n\nYou can now [#7382f0]call in full fleets of smaller starships[], or [#7382f0]reliably call in more combat-capable warships.[]\n\n\n\nJust don't spam Entulae's DMs.
status.exotic-mod-0b-payload-launching.name = Payload Launching 
status.exotic-mod-0b-payload-launching.details = While putting time into research, you played with payloads, managing to make some interesting adaptations to your current tech.\n\nPayload networks allow for [#7382f0]high-throughput distribution[] of items and liquids. Many [#7382f0]later game factories[] require such throughput to function.
status.exotic-mod-0b-advanced-production.name = Advanced Production
status.exotic-mod-0b-advanced-production.details = [accent]< < < REQUIRED TECH > > >[]\n\nOn successfully integrating higher capacity parts into your factories, you sought to [#7382f0]increase their output and efficiency[] in the process.\n\nThese large, industrial grade structures [#7382f0]take many resources to operate.[]
